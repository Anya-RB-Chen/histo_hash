# histo_hash
This project is for the individual algorithm assignment of COMP3022 in PolyU.

## Environment Setting

Package	          Version

python	          3.9.12

matplotlib	      3.6.2

opencv	          4.6.0

numpy	            1.22.3

scikit-learn	    1.2.0

## Run

The source code is implemented by python and mainly on the Jupyter Notebook, which is easy to deploy in cloud computing. 

If no cloud service is available, then I recommend to install the Jupyter service locally or use Google Collab instead to run the kernel.

```jupyter notebook main.ipynb```

## Dataset
MNIST & StanfordDogsDataset
